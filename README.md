# Virtual Spatial Navigation

How do we know where we are? That's what we hope to answer. In this project, we are designing a virtual spatial navigation game for humans.

The ability to orient ourselves in space and time is vital to navigating our lives and understanding our own memories. Extensive research has been done in mouse models to explore how rodents navigate the world, but research is often not directly comparable to human behaviour.

The objective of this project is to replicate a spatial task that is used in mice as a video game for humans.  This would allow us to compare performance between species.

The “game” is a test of spatial memory. It will allow a subject to enter a circular arena to try and find a hidden target. The arena has many holes on the floor. One hole will contain the hidden target (such as a ball) that the player tries to find and click on. There may or may not be visual cues around the arena to help with orientation. The player will then be made to do this task several times to see if they improve in their searching ability.
